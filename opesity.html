    <p>obesity is acomplex ,chronic disease with several causes that lead to excessive
      body fat and sometimes poor health.</p>
    <h2> Is obesity defined by your weight?</h2>
    <p> Healthcare providers commonly use the Body Mass Index (BMI) to define obesity in the general population. The BMI
      measures average body weight against average body height. As a generalization, healthcare providers associate a
      BMI of 30 or higher with obesity. Although BMI has its limitations, it’s an easily measurable indicator and can
      help alert you to obesity-related health risks.</p>
    <h2>What are the three types of obesity?</h2>
    <p>.Healthcare providers classify obesity into class types based on how severe it is. They use BMI to do it. If your
      BMI is between 25.0 and 29.9 kg/m², they put you in the overweight category. There are three general classes of
      obesity that healthcare providers use to evaluate what treatments may work best for each person. </p>
    <h2>What is “morbid” obesity?</h2>
    <p> Morbid obesity" is an outdated term for class III obesity. In medical language, “morbidity” means associated
      health risks. Doctors referred to class III obesity as “morbid” because it was most likely to come with related
      health problems. However, they retired the term because of its negative connotations. </p>
