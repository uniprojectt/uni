            the desired effect, or be ineffective in treating the disease they target.

            Increased risk of addiction Some non-prescription medications may have addictive properties and using them
            incorrectly or in isolation can increase the risk of addiction to them.

            negative impact on your general health condition or an increase in the symptoms you suffer from.
